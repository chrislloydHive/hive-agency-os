SEO performance is solid, leveraging Apple's domain authority to capture extensive search visibility. However, the absence of a Google Business Profile is noted, which could be leveraged for enhancing local visibility.\n\nThe digital footprint is largely comprehensive, with a strong social media presence and high engagement across platforms like Instagram and YouTube.
