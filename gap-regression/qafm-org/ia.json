The absence of a Google Business Profile severely limits local search visibility, a critical factor for attracting local foot traffic. Additionally, the lack of a coherent brand narrative and structured content strategy further restricts its outreach and engagement potential.\n\nThe website, while functional, suffers from a lack of strategic conversion paths, which can affect user engagement and marketability. Improving these areas with targeted content development, a strong digital footprint, and enhanced SEO practices will be essential in elevating the market's presence and impact in the community.",
